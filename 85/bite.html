<p>After <a href="../../../../../bites/19/">Bite 19. Write a simple property</a> let's write a bit more advanced one.</p>
<p>In this Bite you are presented with a <code>NinjaBelt</code> class that keeps track of scores and Ninja Belts earned (a very real scenario). Some setup code has been provided like the <code>_score</code> and <code>_last_earned_belt</code> variables and the getter and setter methods that make up the property.</p>
<p>The goal is to write a property called <code>score</code> that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure it can only be assigned an integer,</li>
<li>It can not be assigned a score lower than the current score,</li>
<li>It checks in <code>BELTS</code> if a new belt was earned (for example going from 49 to 50 you earn the <em>yellow belt</em>), if so it stores it in <code>self._last_earned_belt</code>.</li>
<li>For each new score print a message:
<ul>
<li>If a new badge was earned: "<em>Congrats, you earned {score} points obtaining the PyBites Ninja {rank} Belt" </em>(where <em>rank</em> is the name of the belt titlecased, e.g. <em>White</em>, <em>Yellow</em>, etc.)</li>
<li>Else just the new score: "<em>Set new score to {score}"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

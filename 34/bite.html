<p>This Bite is about implementing a <code>User</code> class that keeps track of <em>karma</em> points received (Bite idea came from <a href="https://github.com/pybites/karmabot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our karmabot</a>).</p>
<p>As it is an <em>Advanced</em> Bite we have you look at the tests to figure out the implementation, but we will say that the class uses 3 <em>magic/special/dunder</em> methods and 3 <em>properties</em>.</p>
<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>

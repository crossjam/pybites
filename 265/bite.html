<p>Here is another classic algorithm problem wrapped in a Bite. Enjoy!</p>
<p>A mayor in a remote mountain village faced an emergency and he needs your help. He just learned a poor boy is very sick, and will need to go to the city hospital immediately.</p>
<p>He only has one night to collect the contribution from the villagers, so that he can escort the boy and his family to the city next morning. Luckily, he has kept a 'secret list' of each family's "financial status + willingness to help" in his file over the years.</p>
<p>So the challenge is how to find the starting family in the geographicly sparse mountain area, making sure he can collect maximum funds.</p>
<p>The goal is to help the mayor to collect the maximum contribution and determine which families to start (and end). These are the key elements of this mission:</p>
<p>To find the families in the closest neighborhood in the village with best possible donations that he can collect. You can think of this closest neighborhood as - "contiguous families block" in the "list", without circulating back. Since time is essence in this matter, he wants to get the funds quickly and prepare for next day's trip.</p>
<p>Let's make some concrete examples to illustrate these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: the list represents that each family's 'capacity' to contribute in $dollars_amount: it could be one of these values: positive, negative, or zero. For example: [0, 1, 2, 4, -3, -3]</li>
<li>Note - the mountain village could have hundreds of families scattered around in wide area, so he would just go in one-direction. Therefore he prefers one-way trips (not circular!) - one pass. (this is known in CS as O(n) time requirement)</li>
<li>Output: 3 items he needs to know - the maximum contribution (amount), starting<em>family, ending</em>family (eg. by its index). See below examples.</li>
<li>Bonus - it will be great if you can help him find out the possibility of positive donations - e.g. there is at least one family can contribute before he starts the night trip. If the "donations" are negative - meaning all families are poor - then you could give him a warning message: "Mission impossible. No one can contribute.", exiting the program with (0, 0, 0) - see example 4 below.</li>
</ul>
<pre>##### Examples:

###### Example 1
input:
   village =  [0, -3, 2, 1, -7, 5, 3, -1, 6]
     # index   0   1   2  3  4   5  6  7  8
     #                          ************
&gt;&gt;&gt; max_fund(village)
   (13, 6, 9)      # Since mayor is not an engineer, you will need to convert the index offset
▸␣␣␣               ▸from zero to one.  (eg. start + 1, end + 1)
   fund: 13;
   starting at 6;  index 5 + 1
   ending at 9;    indext 8 + 1 (from mayor's perspective - the first position should be ONE)

###### Example 2
input:
   One  = [0, 1, -1, -5, 0, 4, -3, -2]

&gt;&gt;&gt; max_fund(one)
  (4, 6, 6))

###### Example 3
input:
   penniless = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -5, -2, -1, -3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; max_fund(penniless)
  (1, 5, 5))

###### Example 4
input:
   extremes  = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; max_fund(extremes)
   'Mission Impossible. No one can contribute!'
  (0, 0, 0)
